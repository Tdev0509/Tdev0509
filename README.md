- ðŸ‘‹ MY MOTTO --- "Fast Delivery, Client Satisfaction!".

- ðŸ‘€ I'm an experienced software developer with over 6 years of experience in frontend && backend development, primarily using C# (ASP), Django (framework), Flutter, Angular, React, Node, PHP as my main weapons. I'm capable of developing Frontends && Backends for conventional websites with real-time capabilities, and fluent in backend APIs for mobile and/or web applications.

- ðŸ‘€ I'm equally proficient in relational databases (such as MySQL and PostgreSQL) as well as NoSQL storage approaches (like MongoDB, ArangoDB, Redis and CouchBase). Additionally, I'm experienced in working with a wide range of services (like S3, SES, SNS, Twilio, Stripe, Mailchimp). Basic frontend skills (HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, Angular, React-Redux) are the hallmark of any decent full stack developer - so of course I'm very comfortable with these tools as well.

- ðŸ‘€ I've built scalable architecture with Docker and containerization techniques, and stood up messaging services like Celery and RabbitMQ. I've dirtied my hands with AWS deployments including continuous deployment.

- ðŸ‘€ I am a naturally curious person and am eager to help you get the most out of your next project.
